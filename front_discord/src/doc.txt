We use useRef when:

1) We want to connect React code to a real DOM element
input ↔ button
scroll container ↔ auto-scroll
2) We need memory that must survive re-renders
timers
sockets
previous values
3) We do NOT want UI to re-render
performance
control-only data

📌 So the accurate sentence is:
useRef is for DOM access and persistent non-UI memory



file.type.startsWith("image/")
Reason:
1) User may rename .exe to .jpg
2) Browser MIME type exposes real type
3) Backend expects image


//image flow of uplaoding
Frontend selects file
↓
Preview via Base64
↓
Upload via multipart
↓
Backend saves file
↓
DB stores only URL
↓
WebSocket broadcasts message
↓
Frontend receives instantly



why use Base64
    Because:
    No backend call needed
    Instant preview
    Temporary
    ❌ Bad for storage
    ❌ Increases size by ~33%
